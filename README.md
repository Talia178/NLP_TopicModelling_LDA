# NLP_TopicModelling_LDA
In this project, I'll visualize text data using WordCloud, employ the LDA model for topic modeling, and compute coherence scores to assess the model's quality and find the optimal number of topics. I'll create an interactive visualization with pyLDAvis, saving it as an HTML link for exploration.
